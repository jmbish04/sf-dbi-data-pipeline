# Privacy Considerations for Inspector Analytics Pipeline

## Overview
The SF Inspector Analytics Pipeline processes sensitive data related to inspector performance and activities. This document outlines privacy considerations and implemented measures to protect individual privacy while enabling analytical insights.

## Data Privacy Principles

### 1. Data Minimization
- Only collect data necessary for performance analytics and workload optimization
- Aggregate data at appropriate levels to reduce individual identification risks
- Implement automatic data purging based on retention policies

### 2. Anonymization and Pseudonymization
- **Inspector IDs**: Replace real inspector identifiers with anonymized IDs using pattern `INS[0-9A-F]{8}`
- **Geographic Data**: Limit precision to zone-level rather than specific addresses
- **Temporal Data**: Aggregate to hour-level granularity to prevent precise activity tracking

### 3. Purpose Limitation
- Data collected exclusively for:
  - Performance improvement initiatives
  - Workload distribution optimization
  - Resource allocation planning
  - Training needs assessment
- Prohibited uses:
  - Individual performance disciplinary actions without additional due process
  - Public disclosure of individual performance metrics
  - Third-party commercial purposes

## Implementation Measures

### 1. Data Schema Protections
- **Required privacy metadata**: Every record includes `privacy_metadata` object
- **Anonymization flag**: Tracks whether personal identifiers have been anonymized
- **Retention periods**: Automatic enforcement of data retention limits
- **Geographic precision controls**: Configurable geographic granularity

### 2. Processing Safeguards
- **Batch processing**: 5-minute aggregation windows reduce real-time tracking capabilities
- **Statistical aggregation**: Focus on patterns rather than individual events
- **Differential privacy**: Consider implementing differential privacy for sensitive metrics

### 3. Access Controls
- **Role-based access**: Limit access to analytics data based on job functions
- **Audit logging**: Track all access to inspector analytics data
- **Data sharing agreements**: Formal agreements required for any data sharing

### 4. Storage and Transmission Security
- **Encryption at rest**: All data stored in encrypted R2 buckets
- **Encryption in transit**: HTTPS/TLS for all data transmission
- **Secure pipelines**: Cloudflare Pipelines with compression and batching

## Compliance Considerations

### 1. Legal Framework
- **California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)**: Applicable to employee data processing
- **San Francisco Fair Chance Ordinance**: Considerations for employment-related analytics
- **Public Records Act**: Balance between transparency and privacy

### 2. Retention Policies
- **Default retention**: 365 days for aggregated performance metrics
- **Detailed records**: 90 days for individual inspection events
- **Anonymized data**: 3 years for long-term trend analysis
- **Automatic purging**: Implemented via pipeline configuration

### 3. Individual Rights
- **Right to know**: Inspectors informed about data collection and use
- **Right to correct**: Mechanisms to correct inaccurate performance data
- **Right to delete**: Procedures for data deletion requests (where legally permissible)

## Monitoring and Auditing

### 1. Privacy Impact Assessments
- **Quarterly reviews**: Regular assessment of privacy risks
- **Algorithm auditing**: Review of analytical algorithms for bias
- **Third-party audits**: Annual external privacy audits

### 2. Incident Response
- **Data breach procedures**: Established protocols for data incidents
- **Privacy violation reporting**: Clear channels for reporting privacy concerns
- **Remediation processes**: Structured approach to addressing privacy issues

## Technical Implementation

### 1. Data Pipeline Configuration
```javascript
// Privacy-preserving pipeline configuration
{
  name: 'sf-inspector-analytics',
  r2: 'sf-inspector-data',
  seconds: 300,        // 5-minute batching reduces real-time tracking
  mb: 100,            // Batch size optimization
  shards: 1,          // Single shard for consistent processing
  compression: 'gzip' // Secure compression
}
```

### 2. Schema Validation
- All data must conform to `inspector-analytics-schema.json`
- Required privacy metadata fields enforce privacy controls
- Validation prevents storage of non-compliant data

### 3. Anonymization Process
- Inspector IDs generated using cryptographic hash with salt
- Geographic coordinates rounded to zone-level precision
- Temporal data aggregated to prevent precise tracking

## Best Practices

### 1. Design Principles
- **Privacy by design**: Privacy considerations integrated from initial design
- **Default privacy**: Most restrictive privacy settings as default
- **Transparency**: Clear documentation of data practices

### 2. Operational Procedures
- **Regular training**: Staff training on privacy requirements
- **Policy updates**: Regular review and update of privacy policies
- **Documentation**: Maintain comprehensive privacy documentation

### 3. Continuous Improvement
- **Feedback mechanisms**: Regular feedback from inspectors and stakeholders
- **Technology updates**: Adopt new privacy-preserving technologies
- **Regulatory compliance**: Stay current with evolving privacy regulations
