# SF DBI Data Pipeline

This repository contains helper scripts for setting up R2 buckets and Cloudflare Pipelines used by the San Francisco Department of Building Inspection data workflow.

## Requirements
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) 18+
- [`wrangler`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/) configured with your Cloudflare account credentials

## Setup
Install dependencies (none currently) and run the scripts using Node.js.

```
npm install
```

### Create R2 Buckets
Run `scripts/create_r2_buckets.js` to create the required R2 buckets.

```
node scripts/create_r2_buckets.js
```

### Create Pipelines
Run `scripts/create_pipelines.js` to create the Cloudflare Pipelines.

```
node scripts/create_pipelines.js
```

Both scripts simply wrap `wrangler` commands and will log errors if creation fails.
